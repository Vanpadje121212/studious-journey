This directory contains a partial dump of Greasy Fork's database. The purpose of making this available is:

1. To allow those working on Greasy Fork to have real-ish data to work with. See https://github.com/JasonBarnabe/greasyfork/wiki/Running-Greasy-Fork-locally.
2. To allow for easier recovery should Greasy Fork get hit by a bus.

This dump contains:

 - Public, administrative data like script types, locales, etc.
 - A full list of users, though containing only user name and profile.
 - Scripts that users have flagged to allow redistribution and data related to those scripts.

It does not contain:

 - A full list of all scripts on Greasy Fork.
 - User e-mails, passwords, or login methods.
 - Forum data like discussions, comments, or private messages.
 
The scripts contained in this dump, while flagged as redistributable for this purpose by their authors, are still subject to the license the authors have specified.
